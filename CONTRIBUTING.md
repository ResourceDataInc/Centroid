# Contributing

To file a bug report or request a feature, open a new [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ResourceDataInc/Centroid/issues/new).

To contribute code/documentation changes, complete the following steps:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/ResourceDataInc/Centroid/fork) the repository.
1. Create a feature branch and commit your changes.
1. Submit a pull request. Please include a good summary and description of your contribution. We encourage early pull requests.

## Guidelines

1. If a new language implementation is being added (e.g. JavaScript, hint, hint), then please implement the API such that it matches the other language APIs.
1. Code should have tests. Currently the language specific tests match one to one - we plan to keep it that way until we find a good reason to diverge.
1. For changes to existing language APIs, please follow along with whatever coding standards that you see in the existing code.
